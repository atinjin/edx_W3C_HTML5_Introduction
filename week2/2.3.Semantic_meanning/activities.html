            </header>
            <div>
                The <span>div</span> tag is one you will likely see sprinkled all over an HTML document.
                It is used to define a <span>division</span> or a section of the document.
                Div is not a semantic element, however, it is commonly used when there isn't a better semantic assignment for it.
